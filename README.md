<h1>Banking Networking Project</h1>
This banking network project I will be using CISCO Packet Tracer to demostartes networking knowledge and practical hands on skills that can be used in any industry/enterprise. This project will show how different host devices are configured to different access points; distribution layers, core layers; servers and are able to communicate with one another. The project will be networked to maintain redundancy which will allow host devices to communicate with other devices in the network if one goes down as well as security measure implement to keep the transfer of data and its accessibility secured.
